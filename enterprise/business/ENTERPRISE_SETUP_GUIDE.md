## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Server Connection Issues**

#### **Problem**: Client shows "🟡 STANDBY Server Status: Server Not Available"
**Solution**:
1. Verify server is running: `netstat -an | findstr "8888"`
2. Start server if needed: `.\target\release\sniperforge.exe`
3. Use `refresh` command in client to reconnect

#### **Problem**: "Connection timeout" errors
**Solution**:
1. Check server process is active
2. Verify no firewall blocking localhost:8888
3. Restart server and client if persistent

### **Strategy Management Issues**

#### **Problem**: Strategy not found in cache
**Solution**:
1. Use `refresh` command to update cache
2. Verify server connection with `ls` command
3. Check strategy is properly deployed on server

#### **Problem**: Commands not responding
**Solution**:
1. Check connection status in dashboard
2. Try `cd /` to return to root context
3. Use `help` to verify available commands
