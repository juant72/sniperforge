# üö® WALLET SAFETY MEASURES - CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE

## URGENT SECURITY NOTICE
**A critical wallet draining issue has been identified and addressed with multiple safety layers.**

## NEW SAFETY PROTECTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. üõ°Ô∏è Maximum Swap Amount Limits
- **Mainnet**: Maximum 0.1 SOL per transaction
- **DevNet**: Maximum 1.0 SOL per transaction
- **Purpose**: Prevent accidental large swaps that could drain wallet

### 2. üí∞ Balance Verification with Safety Margin
- Checks wallet balance before every swap
- Maintains 0.01 SOL safety margin for transaction fees
- Prevents swaps that would leave insufficient funds for fees
- Aborts transaction if insufficient balance detected

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Large Swap Warnings
- Warns when swapping >50% of wallet balance on Mainnet
- Provides clear logging of balance vs. swap amount
- Helps prevent accidental large transactions

### 4. üîç Transaction Amount Verification
- Verifies that the transaction amount exactly matches the requested amount
- Double-checks quote amounts before signing
- Detects potential manipulation attempts
- Aborts if any amount mismatch is detected

### 5. üö® Final Safety Confirmation
- 2-second delay before signing Mainnet transactions
- Clear warnings about real money usage
- Last chance for manual intervention

### 6. üìä Post-Transaction Balance Monitoring
- Verifies wallet balance after successful transactions
- Warns if balance drops below 0.001 SOL
- Helps detect unexpected balance changes

## SAFETY ABORT CONDITIONS

The system will automatically abort transactions in these cases:
1. **Swap amount exceeds maximum limits**
2. **Insufficient wallet balance**
3. **Cannot verify wallet balance**
4. **Quote amount mismatch detected**
5. **Transaction simulation fails**

## USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Mainnet Trading:
1. **Never swap more than you can afford to lose**
2. **Start with small amounts (0.001-0.01 SOL)**
3. **Verify transaction details carefully**
4. **Keep emergency funds in a separate wallet**
5. **Monitor transactions on Solana Explorer**

### For DevNet Testing:
1. **Use DevNet for all testing and development**
2. **Test new features on DevNet first**
3. **Verify functionality before moving to Mainnet**

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Funds Are Missing:
1. **Check transaction history on Solana Explorer**
2. **Review log files in `logs/` directory**
3. **Verify wallet address and network**
4. **Document transaction signatures for investigation**

### If Unexpected Behavior:
1. **Stop all trading immediately**
2. **Check system logs for errors**
3. **Verify network configuration**
4. **Test on DevNet before continuing**

## CONFIGURATION FILES

The safety measures are implemented in:
- `src/shared/jupiter.rs` - Core safety logic
- `config/mainnet.toml` - Mainnet configuration
- `config/devnet.toml` - DevNet configuration

## TESTING THE SAFETY MEASURES

To test the safety protections:

```bash
# Test maximum amount limit (should be rejected)
cargo run --bin sniperforge -- test swap-real --wallet test-wallet.json --network devnet --amount 2.0 --confirm

# Test with insufficient balance (should be rejected)
cargo run --bin sniperforge -- test swap-real --wallet empty-wallet.json --network devnet --amount 0.1 --confirm

# Test normal operation (should work)
cargo run --bin sniperforge -- test swap-real --wallet test-wallet.json --network devnet --amount 0.001 --confirm
```

## VERSION CONTROL

- **Safety measures implemented**: June 27, 2025
- **Jupiter integration version**: v6 API
- **Transaction format**: Legacy (for DevNet compatibility)

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**üö® ALWAYS USE DEVNET FOR TESTING**
**üö® VERIFY NETWORK BEFORE REAL TRANSACTIONS**
**üö® START WITH SMALL AMOUNTS ON MAINNET**
**üö® KEEP EMERGENCY FUNDS SEPARATE**
