//! REORGANIZED: Professional SniperForge Test Suite
//! 
//! This file has been reorganized into a professional test structure.
//! All tests have been moved to organized modules in tests/ directory:
//! 
//! - tests/unit/mod.rs       - Unit tests for individual components
//! - tests/integration/mod.rs - Integration tests for system components  
//! - tests/security/mod.rs    - Security and validation tests
//! - tests/performance/mod.rs - Performance and stress tests
//! - tests/mod.rs            - Test utilities and helpers
//!
//! Run tests with: cargo test
//! Run specific modules: cargo test unit::config_tests
//!
//! This approach provides:
//! ✅ Clear separation of concerns
//! ✅ Professional organization
//! ✅ Maintainable test structure
//! ✅ Easy test discovery and execution
//! ✅ Comprehensive coverage with proper categorization
